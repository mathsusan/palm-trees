# CSS Debug Lab

This project is intended to be used to teach about CSS and how to debug problems. Thus, it may not follow many best practices. The CSS is overly complicated so that the problems might be more complex. We created this project in Angular but you do not need to know angular to be sucessful in our workshop.

## Install dependencies

1. This project requires node v18.15.0, we recommend you use node version manager to change versions of node. Instructions can be found here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

2. Install the angular cli `npm install -g @angular/cli`

3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
